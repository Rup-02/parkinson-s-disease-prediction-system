This project presents a comprehensive review for the prediction of 
Parkinson disease by using machine learning based algorithms like random forest , svm etc. 
The brief introduction of various computational intelligence techniques based approaches used 
for the prediction of Parkinson diseases are presented . The dataset is preprocessed using 
normalization techniques to enhance the performance of the models. Feature importance is 
analyzed to identify the most significant predictors of the disease. Hyperparameter tuning is 
performed to optimize model performance, achieving improved precision, recall, and F1 
scores. This project also presents the summary of results obtained by various researchers 
available in literature to predict the Parkinson diseases.
